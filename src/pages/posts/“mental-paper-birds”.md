### **Mental paper birds**

Flowing like water,\
exploding as bombs\
are thoughts blanked.

Come with your first flight!\
And don’t just fool around!\
And don’t let others ruin your shine!\
Figure elusive flies on my mind\
please one more time.

No earthquakes,\
no speeches,\
no world wars\
will stop the flocks,\
flocks of migrant birds,\
from logging on to my prison!\
A limited inner prison:\
call it what you want,\
call it brain.

Some of them…\
Some of them have landscapes\
from craggy hills:\
sandy banks\
where the birds socialize, eat\
and where no one can molest us!

How many times do you save me!\
Countless were the ones\
during the after-work sunset\
when my longing was fulfilled\
with a warm wist, warm wings\
bringing me gradually\
to the realm of dreams

until I feel my feet touching\
ground again on Earth.
