### **N.1**

Here, dear rising sea,\
your waters ripple calmly\
despite all my cries;\
these pacify lawns of soul.\
A peace in my urban life?

### **N.2**

You’re milk with essence.\
Freedom and sinking essence.\
Pains are seasonings\
scarce in the paint: milky way.\
Raise and hang me in your tides.

### **N.3**

Chimera drawings\
are on your fragile surface.\
So much you reclaim\
with one of seven trumpets\
that coexist with human.

### **N.4**

A lone little fish\
peeks out from bottom seaweed.\
The wrathful waves, hook\
postmortem announced by these,\
finally comes full circle.

### **N.5**

I unearth the tomb;\
its need no-more by currents\
crossing sea pits. Which\
are our old creators and\
evolution gravediggers.

### **N.6**

I listen loud calls\
in quiet waves of your stay.\
I feel cool breezes\
from icy poles that stain sand.\
I seek to infer your drops.

### **N.7**

The state of water\
oozes from corners of death.\
Without despair kick,\
watches infinite lives pass:\
the oldest “living” being.

### **N.8**

Your blue stirs me up.\
Prominent mental algae\
sinks deep in journey\
to light forgotten creatures:\
discover or devour us.

### **N.9**

Multiple questions\
hide in your empty blankets\
rippling forever.\
Neither ship nor some sailor\
will be free to tame you, sea.

### **N.10**

For now, it’s quiet.\
Your abysmal presence comes\
and little talk goes.\
But some reflections’ enough\
to move again from waters.
