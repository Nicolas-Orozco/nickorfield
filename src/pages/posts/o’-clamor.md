### **O' clamor**

Fruit of the path,\
so many times\
I pointed to your present\
as a treasure\
hidden\
when I still\
can’t find\
mine.

Fruit of the path,\
in what parts\
do you fork,\
you are reborn wizened,\
and bloom light?

I hope one day\
to travel the winds\
absent of clocks,\
and among your threads\
mellifluous with your\
magic touch.\
With you, my fruit,\
fruit of the path.
