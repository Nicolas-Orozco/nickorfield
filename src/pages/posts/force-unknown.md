### **Force unknown**

The right step passes to the left,\
creates my parallel confused side\
that swims without pain or glory.\
A force unknown pushes.

By letting myself get caught\
between clouds of doubts and answers\
all incomplete as firewood.\
A force unknown traps.

And the angel will be sent\
with a horrifying testimony\
to my blasphemous temptation.\
A force unknown warns.
