### **Notes from Drags the Death**

On precipitous seasons wanders,\
making noise sound as rich vowels,\
sitting in so-many salt paradises\
alike wintering, watering people’s eyes.

“The echoes of Grim” a lander cried.\
As if I wasn’t sure about that\
of folding himself cloud to crowd,\
from lives’ end set after a dirk shrive

in a filled-with-darkness pocket,\
wandering the news front to back\
not to expect “Get out of my land”\
if you’d love to see their docket — he’s into that.
