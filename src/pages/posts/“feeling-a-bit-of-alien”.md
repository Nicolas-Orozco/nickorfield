### **Feeling a bit of alien**

Well, it was just a weird dream:

Moonlight’s running with the dogs\
while a night rain quenches my thirst.\
Swaying my head comes in a burst,\
a pain burst only silenced by the Fog of war.

I just try to sew nimbly\
all the melting people I see,\
all the natural light blue apples I eat,\
and all the fishes skimming skies.

The pen(cil), which drew this land,\
now seeks just to erase every delight,\
every sin or cry with its prophetic flight.\
Will this be my death command?

Then or now, clocks stopped,\
or maybe it was tired eyes.\
A perfect dream fantasy-only,\
one day, will trigger chests filled\
with instruments of war and love.

Well, it was just a weird dream…
