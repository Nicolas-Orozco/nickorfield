### **Papers on the Mural**

Your cracks are full of pushes,\
on the rough surface you place yourself\
so that you patiently wind\
to trees still alive in history\
stained with ink or pencil\
where you keep that papered death,\
that departure, that bitter drink, that journey,\
where you enjoyed and where you sobbed,\
when you wanted to explore spatial horizons\
with your thousands of projects and plans\
but you gave and received everyday life.

They donâ€™t go away; they are still there,\
receiving the breeze from the window\
without any fluttering:\
waiting for you to sing your dreams\
and write your hopes on them once more.
