### **Another path, another day**

From avenue to avenue, where do we go?\
Fire among fire, where do we go?\
You became the unchanging form\
leading me to boredom.\
The stinging pin also did not sink\
nor illuminated the palace of the dear Hypnos.\
You’ve been living long with your pattern\
of definite yellowish lines, too definite.\
If only you could start over,\
you’d end up at the first dark, forgotten stop,\
where you lengthen again.\
Will you be shaking all over again?\
In front of the millennial spirits you buried,\
Believed to be the future of the first millennium.\
So empty the bottom of your presence, as much as\
the canyons through which you never walked,\
the drowning precipices\
and the roundabout of depressions.\
A more common path for man,\
still ancient, still a traveler.
