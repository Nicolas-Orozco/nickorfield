### **Petroso**

Pride is sunk.\
And the longed-for doors were suddenly closed\
in front of frozen faces.\
Swords flow, and wars\
never won or lost.\
Dictators, colonels, and generals\
marchers in terrestrial oblivion.\
Dancing is the stars\
with their happy memories in the cosmos.\
Arms carry poisoned lambs\
passed from the feast of excess.\
Scales are imminent in carnal life\
if we continue to fight them.\
Fortunately, bound a mind is silent\
as long as it receives home and pills,\
whether in the sea or sky.

### **Carry me, current**

Those adjoining “plates”\
perform their daily gathering of tulips.\
The hungry mountains run\
and cry out from the depths\
in Poseidon’s land.\
Sin lies withered,\
withered from the ironic sorrow\
of a living absurdity.\
Light the weight of all in the days….\
Of course, and I am Sisyphus…\
Staggering is Death\
when he enjoys waiting (?)\
the chest in the leg and the dagger in hand.

### **MODERN STORM**

A difficult way\
to open the wallet.\
It said on a bloody note\
languidly:\
BURGLARS, HIGH-SENSITIVITY PILLS, THRONE ROOM BANDS IN\
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON: UNIFORMED OFFICERS CRITICALLY SOUGHT\
NO CONFIDENCE IN JASON. DO NOT BOTHER CREATING A BATTLEFIELD, PLAYGROUND, OR MICROFOOTY LANE. FEELING THINGS ARE OVERWHELMING. LOOSE-WORD, STRAIGHT-UP CRAZY, SIX-DAY HEROES ON THE STREET, VERY POWERFUL, MASKED SICK MOVE, DANGEROUS, CORRUPTION, JANUARY 2015: AMERICA’S DISASTER: A HIGH HEEL-FILLED RETURN, AMERICA’S FEELINGS, TUNNEL SCAN, THREE-THOUSAND SMUGGLERS SEEN NOT JUST A YOUNGER SIDE OF THE SIDELINES. TENSIONS RUMBLING, OBLIGATION CONTRACTS.\
WAITING ON TRUTH, SHOOTING, BEATING, BLACK COLLAR ECLIPSES, PUBLIC DISHONOR, DEADLY DEATH, SUITING, THE ISOLATION, THE EXECUTIONS, THE SONS OF CROSS AFTER BRUTAL STEAL. RETRIEVAL\
HEROES ARE WEIGHING DOWN, DEATH, DEATH, TURNING INTO FEAR\
SHOOTING-OVERRIDE VIDEO, ONLY THE CLOSEST TO KNOW.

### **Soporte**

Happy losses.\
Dictators longed for front and excess.\
Scales are wars\
never closed\
suddenly from the cosmos.\
Poisoned arms,\
last pills,\
be he of the swords with pride.\
And expensive homes and sunken earthly colonels.\
Dancing is carnal oblivion\
whether fortune or lambs heaven in a mind that receives\
marching generals. Hush\
as long as you see the stars;\
these carry out in the imminent frost.\
Flow in the sea the bound cattle,\
their memories of feasting,\
that we keep on fighting.\
Nor by doors, he came to life.
