### **“Light’s in the back; not here”**

Find formulas?\
Very well with my passages walk,\
on our once-paved roads\
of Rome, of old-fashioned love.

I keep on hiding in your bushes\
and in the wind I sense storms:\
airs of a world to come.

Cracks in the earth,\
I keep wanting to help them.\
What was fertile\
infected by what was not?

Only to fall on the slope\
into a swampy river —\
from which I may not get up.
