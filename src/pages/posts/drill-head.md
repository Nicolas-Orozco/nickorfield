### **Drill head**

In gravel, precious gold, is driving me crazy;\
where I found it is a secret,\
so that even Zeus’ sadness falls.\
And I’m its spontaneous puppet\
forever discerning love slowly.

And in me sin shuns\
from this exhausting journey,\
from my accidential actions\
of a mineral that illuminates my entrails\
in this wanted warm feeling never to know,\
never, not in tomorrow.
