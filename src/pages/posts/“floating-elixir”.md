### **Floating elixir**

Sometimes they forgot us.\
Maybe we’re minuscule.\
And isn’t an option a life posthumous\
with this false elixir that expells and devours.

Limbs are a necessity,\
’Cause where we go they acidify,\
and hurt and is the All-powerful’s penalty.\
Cities, signs, cars, TV\
is all fading away up to their shadow\
of forgotten and useless technology.

Buttery skyscrapers disintegrate.\
Red skies shine eyes\
before converting into ghosts of life.\
A giant storm comes and buys\
our human chains\
that prevent conflict and self-destruction\
for self-given value for dirt, rocks.

Finally, the animal crying returns:\
morality is restriction,\
ethic is for punishment,\
groups as destructuring,\
redemption’s no longer exit.
