### **Redemption**

The fallen longs for a paradise.

The fallen releases the raven.

The lonely fallen accepts his fate.

### **Window**

When I was a child, I used to close the curtains in my room to sleep,\
because when I didn’t, a bright and incessant light would come through my window, sometimes accompanied by a pair of violent eyes.

### **The non-escape**

How could we get out of here? The limits are bordering the barrier of everything we know. The only thing left is to free ourselves from our minds, our prisons, and of that I’m not so sure, but so say the strangers above our soil.

### **Randomness #1**

In the morning, the sun did not rise as usual. That worries me. But remember to make your bed first before.

### **Randomness #2**

I’m left wondering…. I’m right in saying I don’t have it sometimes. Leave me, perceptions, free out of my subjective form and insecurities. Or I might be floating in your incapable minds with no limits!
