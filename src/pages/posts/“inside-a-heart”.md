### **Inside a heart**

The creaking procession of the wind\
cuts our distances and roots within,\
like a deadly thread of a Moira\
only before singing to your love aura

again at the tip with a view of the past,\
with a funereal cliff, wills away passed,\
until we go to the timeless valley of life\
where our lips and bodies will dance.
