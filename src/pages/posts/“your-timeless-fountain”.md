### **Your timeless fountain**

Drink my beloved tears\
before we enter back to Olympus.\
I shall give away all these years\
to joyful enter your heart without fuss.

Entertainment won’t disjunct\
as our emerald celebration prevails,\
as your eyes only get me to jails\
where all of my words only disgrace them.

Gallardic rhythms, these mesmerized\
my poor mind from a gorgeous presence.\
And thanks then I was colonized\
just to hear you outside, inside please in silence.

Inspired, tiredness is not included\
on paintings that pale from you,\
from an essence which flows like a chanted ballad\
which has no ending, to me a sacred virtue.
