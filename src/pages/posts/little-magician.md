### **Little magician**

Magician, magician  \
dry the shining destiny,  \
lucid in its sunny stop  \
with the left.  

Magician, magician,  \
transform the realms of the heavens  \
into samples of capital emptiness.  

With your right hand  \
hooked to a galactic weapon.  

With your left hand  \
pacify the modest evils  \
of youth.  

But don't forget  \
to bring your forgetful cloak  \
nor the fruit juices.
