### **Tranquil interruption**

Crawling in the bushes\
of a simple broken room.\
Push me to the moth-eaten door,\
and with vultures seal me as I emerge\
from the daily nightly confinement.\
In your flickering lights,\
blue, red and yellow run\
the darkness in my skin and eyes.\
Acid in my eyes,\
needles in my feet,\
beneath the layers, an ideal past\
is still locked in my mind.
