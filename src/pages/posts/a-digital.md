### **A digital**  

A specter from the past\
or a tired preacher\
both form a self:\
digital myself.

Present the past\
in its mechanical,\
updated rainbows\
of memory.

Manufacturing the present\
with your tastes.\
A discrete entity\
that runs\
in your footsteps.

I distract you\
with entertainment\
while I mold\
your very being\
most longed for:\
you.
