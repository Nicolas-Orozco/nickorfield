### **The road**

I could be an ancient mountain\
So I could reach the hurried time\
Walking through my pits and errors\
maybe I find a light to shine

Until we won’t stay on the road\
Until we won’t stay on the road\
There, our whistles may float\
Sun’s coming down\
Until we won’t stay on the road

To find your many lakes of mystery\
that once were your followed dreams\
Up hills, you’ve traveled in history\
Go seek your friends, family, and teams

Until we won’t stay on the road\
Until we won’t stay on the road\
There, our whistles may float\
Sun’s coming down\
Until we won’t stay on the road

Remember the walks, all the dogs\
and the many rains in your eyes\
Remember stories in your catalogs\
of houses, memories, and new lifes

Until we won’t stay on the road\
Until we won’t stay on the road\
There, our whistles may float.\
Sun’s coming down.\
Until we won’t stay on the road
