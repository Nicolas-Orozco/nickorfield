First things first — if your name happens to be Flabo, sorry!

Around the final of July, twenty-twenty-two, I got my first smartphone. I couldn’t be happier. Now, I could check my phone in record time for new emails, messages, and news in a portable way.

Sometime later, in November, my computer was in a process of formatting. Moments on, It just gave me a prompt to register a new Windows account.

Naturally, I selected the option for phone numbers. A few keyboard typing later, I got an alert saying my number was already registered with an existing account.

This account had a complex-to-read last name. However, the most identifiable of his name was the first: Flabo.

I was perplexed: If I just got this phone and number, and I was sure no one nor myself used this on an account for Windows, how can this happen?

Finally, I needed to run for a solution; so, with a couple of clicks, I unlinked from this strange account, put it on my own, and forget about him until this time…

Now that I think of it, I could have saved his e-mail and sent him a peculiar mail about his identity. But now I’ll keep it to myself.

To conclude, this, my fellow reader, was how the mysterious Flabo used my unknown phone number in a Windows account — narrated in a try-to-entertain way.
